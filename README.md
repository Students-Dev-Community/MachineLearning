We suggest you to get familiarized with linux, jupyter notebook and virtual environments(Anaconda/Miniconda).


## Python Basics:
1. [FreeCodeCamp Python Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
2. Basic Libraries
   1. [Numpy](https://www.kaggle.com/code/utsav15/100-numpy-exercises)
   2. [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rajacsp/pandas-cheatsheet-125-exercises)
   3. Matplotlib   
   4. Scikit-Learn
<br/>

## Domain 1 (Classical ML):
1. [Vineeth NB Lectures](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AtWe1BwR4TG1askdAdXyLroo1PQ?e=sGbCBM)
2. [Balaraman Ravindran NPTEL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1xHD4vteKYVpaIiy295pg6_SY5qznc77)
3. [Andrew Ng Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)

    ### Skills Required:
   1.  You might encounter some basic probability and statistics, try to learn them as per the requirement.
   2.  Basic learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees.
   3.  Familiarity with data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
   4.  Knowledge of evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) for regression problems and accuracy, precision, and recall for classification problems.
   4.  Proficiency in using Python and popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn for implementing and evaluating supervised learning models.
   5.  Ability to perform basic data exploration and visualization to gain insights from the dataset.
   
   ### Few Project Ideas:
   1. [The Standard Titanic Problem](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) üôÉüôÉ
   2. [The Standard House Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) üè†
   3. [The Standard Iris Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset) ü™ªü™ª
   
   <br/>
   <br/>

## Domain 2 (Deep Learning):

Follow the below order:
### Mathematical Pre-Requisites:
1. [Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D) (Refer the videos in the playlist according to requirement)
   
### Course Work:
1. [Mitesh Khapra's NPTEL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyqSpQzTE6M9gCgajvQbc68Hk_JKGBAYT)
2. [BhikshaRaj's DL Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp-0K3kfddPxRmjgjm0P1WT6H-gTqE8j9) (Highly not recommended for freshers)

### Python Libraries :
Anyone of the following frameworks/libraries is fine though we suggest Pytorch.
1. [Pytorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_ikDlimN6A) üî•
2. [Tensorflow/Keras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpCFfeUEGs8) (Keras Intergration is a bit better than raw Tensorflow. This single reference is just to let you know flavour of tf.)
   
### Basic Projects:
1. MNIST Classification using PyTorch
2. RNN & LSTM Implementation from Scratch


Stay tuned for other domains resources!!üòâüòâ
